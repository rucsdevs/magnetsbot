 * 4th line is to have the event object, which contains details about messages sent to be listened to
 * 5th line allows for listening
 * 6th line specifies permissions
 * 7th line governs how jda fetches and caches member lists (might not be necessary for this bot though)
 * 8th line works with the 7th line and defines which server members jda should keep in cache
