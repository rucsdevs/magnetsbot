# magnetsbot
This it the Java bot for RUCS
Just creating this bot to understand the constituent processes. 
Maybe this can be a "boilerplate" for the Java bot?

# how to run the bot using maven in terminal
Run mvn clean compile
Run mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.RUCS.bot.Bot" to run bot
Enter Ctrl + C on the terminal to stop the bot
